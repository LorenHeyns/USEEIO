# Generating Import Emission Factors from an MRIO 
To generate import emission factors from an MRIO model, the requisite MRIO data and correspondence files must be in place along with helper scripts to process the MRIO, then run the script [generate_import_factors.py](generate_import_factors.py) after changing the basic parameters to specific use of the desired MRIO as the source.

An import factor is created for an environmental flow (e.g., Carbon dioxide) in units of that flow per USD (e.g., kg/USD).

For each year, the following files are generated:

- *US_detail_import_factors_{source}_{year}.csv*: Single set of import factors for the US by detail sector.
- *US_summary_import_factors_{source}_{year}.csv*: Single set of import factors for the US by summary sector.
- *Regional_detail_import_factors_{source}_{year}.csv*: Import factors for each of seven regions, by detail sector, 
- *Regional_summary_import_factors_{source}_{year}.csv*: Import factors for each of seven regions, by summary sector, 
- *import_shares_{year}.csv*: Provides the contribution to sector imports by country
- *multiplier_df_{source}_{year}.csv*: Full dataframe with emission factors and contributions by region and sector.

File names are appended with the BEA schema year, e.g., `_17sch`.

The field in the *_import_factors* files are defined as

| Field | Description | Example
| --- | --- | ---
| Sector | USEEIO sector code | `325111`
| Year | Year of data | 2021
| Unit | Numerator unit for Import factor | kg
| ReferenceCurrency | Denominator unit for Import factor | USD
| PriceType | Price type of ReferenceCurrency | Basic
| Flowable | Name of substance | Carbon dioxide
| Context | Environmental compartment to or from | air
| FlowUUID | ID from FEDEFL | b6f010fb-a764-3063-af2d-bcb8309a97b7
| FlowAmount | Import factor value | 0.57
| BaseIOLevel | BEA IO table basis | Detail

The environmental flows fields are the same as those used for USEEIO which are from the [Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist).

## BEA API Access
To make calls to BEA for service imports data (by BEA service category, country, and year), users must first register at https://apps.bea.gov/api/signup/.
After doing so, users will be provided with an API key to the provided email.
Store this as 'BEA_API_key.yaml' in the API subfolder of the import_emission_factors directory.

## Package requirements
- pandas
- esupy
- fedelemflowlist
- [currencyconverter](https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/)
- pymrio

## MRIO Schema
Processed MRIO objects are stored as `.pkl` files, separately for each year.
These files are dictionaries which contain dataframes with the following keys:

- *M*: rows are flows, columns are regions and commodities
- *N* (optional): rows are impacts, columsn are regions and commodities
- *Bilateral Trade*: rows are regions and commodities, columns are regions
- *output*: rows are regions and commodities, single column is output
